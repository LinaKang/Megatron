It is also recommended to use the 'edit / create content in admin theme' option on the /admin/appearance page.\r\n\r\n\r\n## RECOMMENDED MODULES\r\n***\r\n\r\n- AIS (Adaptive Image Styles) - for automating the creation of alternate image sizes that scale with the detected viewport\r\n- Media - for inserting adaptive images into textarea fields (allows you to choose image style per image)\r\n- Block Class - allows you to easily use ‘visible-phone / visible-tablet / visible-desktop’ type bootstrap styles on blocks of content\r\n\r\n\r\n## MODULES NOT RECOMMENDED\r\n***\r\n\r\n- jQuery update - jquery versions over 1.6.x currently break ctools (which breaks views [which is really, really bad]) - jquery has been updated for the Megatron theme, but not for the admin theme (allowing ctools to function normally)\r\n- Environment Indicator - breaks in jquery versions 1.8+\r\n"}
